# PCAP-Analyser
This program analyses PCAP files to detect the types of network scan that might have been performed in the captured session 

The program will scan for .pcap file in its working directory and prompt the user to type in the name of the .pcap file. Once the name of .pcap file is entered the program goes through the captured PCAP to search for the network scans.
